# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

After clicking "Compose", users will be able to write a tweet, telling the world what they are thinking in less than 140 characters. Error messages will show if users try to submit a tweet with 0 or over 140 characters.

With AJAX, Tweets will be shown in real-time. Tweet content will be stored in MongoDB.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.
